Logging tutorial. Start with the initial commit (a simple script using `print` for logging) and each subsequent commit gradually builds up a more sophisticated logging system. By the end, we have:

1. Debug messages being logged to a file.
2. A command line flag (`-v[vv]`) to determine the log level of the command line output.
3. A SlackHandler that sends errors to a Slack webhook.

To learn more about logging, the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.html), particularly the [Basic Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial) are very good.
